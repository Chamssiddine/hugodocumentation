# Comprehensive Guide to My Remote Development Environment Project with Hugo
I have prepared comprehensive documentation for my remote development environment project, which you can find on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Chamssiddine/remote-dev-env). This documentation will provide you with all the necessary information to get started with the project and make the most out of its features. 

Feel free to check it out and let me know your feedback!

## Getting Started

1. Install Hugo on your machine by following the instructions in the official [documentation](https://gohugo.io).
2. Clone the repository by running this command in your terminal:

```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/Chamssiddine/hugodocumentation.git

```
3. Run the server by navigating to the project directory and running this command:


```sh

$ cd hugodocumentation

$ hugo server

```

## How to modify it to your needs
To modify or add posts, navigate to the `content/posts` directory and make your changes there.

## Further Modification
* For more information on customizing the project beyond just adding or modifying posts, check out the official documentation for the [HugoPaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.
